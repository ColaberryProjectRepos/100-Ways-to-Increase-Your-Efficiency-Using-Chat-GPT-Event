If a woman tells you a husband has a right to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him, how do you react? Do you say that what intimate partners do with each other is up to them? And a woman who condones violence done to her has no one to blame but herself? 

The United Nations defines violence against women as “One of the most widespread, persistent, and devastating human rights violations in our world today. It remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma, and shame surrounding it. Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) is one of the most common public problems affecting the individual, family, and community regardless of their age, race, nationality, and socio-economic status. Apart from the violations of human rights, domestic violence (DV) damages the physical, psychological, sexual, reproductive health and social well-being of the community. 

This Power BI report analyzed survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women. This report also explores different sociodemographic groups that the respondents belong to, including Education Level, Marital status, Employment, and Age group.&nbsp;</b><span style="color: rgb(55, 65, 81); font-family: Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(247, 247, 248);"><b><br></b></span>]&nbsp;</h5><h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>And these Insights&nbsp;<br> [<br><b>The data also shows 2007 had the lowest female justifying Violence Against Women and Girls at 1.59%  The data revealed people with higher education have the lowest justification of Violence of 8.90%. Justification of Violence is highest amongst men for "at least one specific reason" (29.01%)  The data also shows highest justification of violence is between the 15-24 age group at 21.08%, followed by age group 25-34 and 35-49 at 19.70% and 19.34% respectively.&nbsp;<br></b>]&nbsp;<br><br>And these Suggestions<br> <b>[<br>1.According to the data, Violence Justification is highest amongst those with no education (25.40%) and those employed for kind (24.45%). I suggest providing educational programs and resources to help raise education levels in under educated communities, improve job opportunities and provide job training programs to support employment in these communities. I also recommend increasing access to information and media that promote critical thinking and decision-making skills.

2. The data revealed 2018 has the highest justification of Violence by females at 49.69% compared to males in the same year 29.99%. Reducing Justification of violence by females will require providing education and awareness campaigns to educate women about their rights and the consequences of violence, providing resources and support for women who experience violence, including safe shelters and access to legal and medical assistance. Encouraging women to speak out and report incidents of violence, increasing female participation in leadership and decision-making positions and working with communities to change societal attitudes and norms that condone violence against women.

3. The data shows Timor-Leste has the highest Justification of Violence at 46.21% in 2016. Reducing Justification of Violence in Timor-Leste may require a comprehensive approach that addresses both the root causes of violence and its justification. Some suggestions include:
Addressing social, economic, and political factors that contribute to violence.
Encouraging peaceful and inclusive dialogue between conflicting parties.
Strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights.
Investing in education and awareness programs to challenge justifications for violence.
Working with community leaders and traditional leaders to promote non-violent conflict resolution.
4. The Data shows 33.22% believes there is always a reason to justify violence against women. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed and should not be tolerated in any way. To resolve this issue, I recommend the following.
Increase Awareness about the issue and educate people about the harm and consequences of violence against women.
 Strengthen laws and enforcement: Enforce existing laws and regulations that protect women and girls from violence and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions.
Support survivors: Provide access to quality care and support services for survivors of violence, including medical, psychological, and legal assistance.
 Address root causes of violence against women, such as gender inequality, poverty, and discrimination.
 Engage communities including men and boys, to challenge cultural norms and attitudes that perpetuate violence against women.
 Promote gender equality and empower women and girls through education and economic opportunities.
 Improve data collection and analysis to better understand the extent and nature of violence against women and inform effective responses.<br></b><b>]&nbsp;</b><br></h4><h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></h4><h4 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></h4></div><div style="color: purple;"><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></b>Follow up:</div><p>Arrange this into a Power Point presentation with a slide breakdown of</p><p>Slide Title</p><p>Slide Text</p><p>Slide Suggested Picture</p><p>Slide Script</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Bonus Follow up:</span></p><p>Take the script and add it to xome.com<span style="color: rgb(128, 0, 128);"><br></span><br></p>
